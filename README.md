# BSI (Black Swan Indicator) Notes & README

## VIX tl;dr

`The volatility index has a strong negative correlation to the S&P 500. Generally when markets fall, the volatility index climbs and vice versa.`


## VIX (Volatility Index) Calculation Notes

`SA's (Simple Averages) and EWA's (Exponential Weighted Averages) are established for the entire duration of the data set to establish a baseline for comparison across various economic environments. Once this is done we move on to more short term analysis of SMA (Simple Moving Average) and EMA (Exponential Moving Average) of shorter term (about a month) and more intermediate term (6 Months to a year) to determine the likelyhood of a significant move in the short and intermediate term.`

## VIX Investing Highlights

`Investing in the VIX generally requires the use of derivatives. As a result of this investment style there is a decay on all volatility related ETF's. In this example we are analyzing 'UVXY' a fund which attempts to mimic 2X the performance on the volatility index. Because of this, that decay factor is dramatically increased. With that leverage comes the burden of paying interest on borrowed funds and management fees. For this reason, UVXY was chosen for this analysis as a "short" opportunity to capitalize on the decay factor when it is also likely that UVXY will fall. Generall investing in UVXY requires options or a straight "short" position. With options the results are more profitable but should only be used during a "sell" trigger. With shorting, this can be done at almost any time the volatility index isn't well below its standard (roughly 17 handle) value. This program primarily deals with the options trading portion but finding an entry point to "short" the fund is also useful with "buy" and "sell" triggers.`
